# OnTarget
Group project from second year at Cardiff Univeristy. 
We were given the option to create a website using either image, video, or audio analysis. 
We chose image analysis, and created an online social platform for archery clubs across the UK. 
Users can track matches and compete online by uploading images of their target after shooting, 
where the score will be automatically generated.

This is not the original repo for this project, and it is important to note that I am not the sole contributor.
